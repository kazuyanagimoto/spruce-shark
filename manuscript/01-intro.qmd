# Introduction

Quantitative models of marriage and divorce have become a central tool for understanding long-run demographic change and evaluating family policy [e.g., @greenwood2009; @greenwood2016; @voena2015; @reynoso2024]. In the canonical framework of @greenwood2009, the postwar decline in marriage rates and rise in divorce rates are attributed to two secular forces: rising wages, which raise the opportunity cost of home production, and falling prices of home goods, which reduce the gains from specialization within marriage. By embedding a search and matching structure with stochastic match quality into a household allocation model, @greenwood2009 provide a unified quantitative account of U.S. marital dynamics from 1950 to 2000.

Their model, like most quantitative family economics models, is formulated in discrete time. The match quality of married couples follows an AR(1) process discretized via the method of @tauchen1986, and the stationary distribution is computed by iterating on a full transition matrix. This approach is straightforward to implement but scales poorly: the Tauchen approximation produces a dense $N \times N$ transition matrix, so that both value function iteration and the stationary distribution calculation require $O(N^2)$ operations in the number of grid points $N$.

Recent advances in continuous-time methods for heterogeneous agent models [e.g., @achdou2022; @kaplan2018] suggest an alternative. When the match quality follows an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, the continuous-time counterpart of the AR(1) process, the infinitesimal generator is a tridiagonal matrix, and both the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation and the Kolmogorov Forward equation can be solved in $O(N)$ time. This reduction from quadratic to linear complexity can yield substantial computational gains, particularly when fine grids are needed to resolve the divorce threshold accurately.

This paper reformulates the @greenwood2009 marriage and divorce model in continuous time and demonstrates that the continuous-time method replicates the discrete-time equilibrium while offering significant computational advantages. The continuous-time formulation replaces the AR(1) match quality process with an OU process, the Bellman equations with HJB equations incorporating a variational inequality for endogenous divorce [cf. @mellior2024], and the stationary distribution iteration with a Kolmogorov Forward equation. By applying the HACT (Heterogeneous Agent Continuous Time) approach of @achdou2022, all numerical operations reduce to tridiagonal linear systems.

The quantitative results show that the continuous-time model closely tracks the discrete-time equilibrium across all key outcomes: the share of married households, the marriage rate, and the divorce rate. Benchmark comparisons confirm that computation time and memory scale as $O(N)$ for the continuous-time method and $O(N^2)$ for the discrete-time method, consistent with the theoretical complexity orders.

The paper is organized as follows. @sec-model presents the continuous-time marriage model. @sec-estimation describes the calibration strategy and reports the simulation results and computational benchmarks. @sec-conclusion concludes. @sec-apdx-gg09 reviews the discrete-time model of @greenwood2009 and its calibration, and @sec-apdx-comp provides computational details on the numerical algorithms.
