# Model {#sec-model}

I reformulate the @greenwood2009 marriage and divorce model in continuous time.^[The full discrete-time model and its calibration are presented in @sec-apdx-gg09.] The economy is populated by a continuum of infinitely-lived households, each either single or married. Households exit the economy with a constant hazard rate $\nu$, and new households enter as singles at the same rate. Each household with $z \in \{1, 2\}$ adults allocates time between market work and home production, yielding an indirect utility $v(p, w, z)$ that depends on the wage $w$ and the price of home goods $p$ (see @sec-apdx-gg09 for details). Each single household meets potential partners with a Poisson arrival rate $\lambda$, and the match quality is drawn from a normal distribution $b \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_s, \sigma_s^2)$, whose CDF and PDF are $F(b)$ and $f(b)$.

## Match Quality {.unnumbered}

The match quality of married households evolves according to an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process:

$$
d b_t = \eta(\mu_m - b_t) dt + \sigma_{m}\sqrt{2\eta}\, dB_t,
$${#eq-ou-process}
where $B_t$ is a standard Brownian motion. Under this parametrization, the stationary distribution of $b_t$ is $\mathcal{N}(\mu_m, \sigma_m^2)$, so $\mu_m$ and $\sigma_m$ have the same interpretation as in the discrete-time AR(1) specification of @greenwood2009.

## Value Functions {.unnumbered}

Let $V(b)$ and $W$ be the value functions of married and single households. Single households choose to marry if $V(b) \geq W$ and remain single otherwise. Married households choose to divorce if $V(b) < W$ and remain married otherwise. This implies the following variational inequality:

$$
V(b) \geq W \quad \text{for all }b \in \mathcal{B},
$$
which defines an endogenous marriage/divorce threshold:

$$
b^* = \inf\{b \in \mathcal{B} : V(b) \geq W\}.
$$

The value functions satisfy the following HJB equations:

$$
\rho W = v(p, w, 1) + \lambda \int_{b^*}^{\infty} V(b') - W \,dF(b'),
$${#eq-hjb-single}

$$
\rho V(b) = v(p, w, 2) + b + \eta(\mu_m - b) \frac{\partial V(b)}{\partial b} + \eta\sigma_m^2 \frac{\partial^2 V(b)}{\partial b^2}.
$${#eq-hjb-married}
The effective discount rate $\rho$ is the sum of the discount rate and the exit rate, $\rho = \tilde{\rho} + \nu$.


## Stationary Distribution {.unnumbered}

The stationary distribution is the solution to the Kolmogorov Forward equation, which is given by

$$
0 = -\frac{\partial}{\partial b}\left[\eta(\mu_m - b)M(b)\right] + \eta\sigma_m^2 \frac{\partial^2 M(b)}{\partial b^2} + \lambda s f(b) - \nu M(b) \quad \text{for } b > b^*,
$${#eq-kf}
where $M(b)$ is the density of married households with match quality $b$, and $s$ is the mass of single households,

$$
s = 1 - \int_{b^*}^{\infty} M(b) \, db.
$${#eq-population-ct}

## Equilibrium {.unnumbered}

A stationary equilibrium is a tuple $\{V(b), W, s, M(b)\}$ such that

1. $W$ and $V(b)$ satisfy @eq-hjb-single and @eq-hjb-married with the same marriage/divorce threshold $b^*$, and
1. $s$ and $M(b)$ constitute a stationary distribution satisfying @eq-kf with @eq-population-ct for all $b > b^*$.
