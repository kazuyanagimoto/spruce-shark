This paper reformulates the @greenwood2009 marriage and divorce model in continuous time using the HACT methods of @achdou2022. The continuous-time formulation replaces the AR(1) match quality process with an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, the Bellman equations with HJB equations incorporating a variational inequality for endogenous divorce, and the transition matrix iteration with a Kolmogorov Forward equation. By exploiting the tridiagonal structure of the OU generator, all numerical operations scale as $O(N)$ in the number of grid points, compared to $O(N^2)$ for the discrete-time Tauchen-based approach.

The quantitative exercises show that the continuous-time method closely tracks the discrete-time equilibrium: the share of married households, the marriage rate, and the divorce rate all follow nearly identical paths from 1950 to 2020 under the same secular trends in wages and the price of home goods. Benchmark comparisons confirm the theoretical complexity gains, with computation time and memory scaling linearly rather than quadratically in the grid size.

There are two directions worth highlighting for future work. First, the current model features exogenous wage and price paths; embedding the continuous-time marriage block into a general equilibrium framework with endogenous prices would be a natural extension, and the $O(N)$ scaling of the continuous-time solver makes this computationally more tractable. Second, richer models of marriage and divorce, such as @reynoso2024, who incorporates endogenous marriage and divorce into an equilibrium framework, or models with human capital accumulation during marriage, add continuous state variables that make the discrete-time approach increasingly costly. The linear scaling of the continuous-time solver in each dimension would make these extensions substantially more feasible.
