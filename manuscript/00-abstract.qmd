# Abstract {.unnumbered}

This paper reformulates the @greenwood2009 marriage and divorce model in continuous time using the HACT methods of @achdou2022. Replacing the AR(1) match quality process with an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process yields a tridiagonal generator, reducing the computational complexity of both the value function and stationary distribution calculations from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ in the number of grid points. The continuous-time model closely replicates the discrete-time equilibrium across all key outcomes, including the share of married households, the marriage rate, and the divorce rate, while achieving substantial gains in computation time and memory usage.
