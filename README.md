# Marriage and Divorce in Continuous Time

[Kazuharu Yanagimoto](https://kazuyanagimoto.com/)

## Abstract

This paper reformulates the Greenwood and Guner (2009) marriage and
divorce model in continuous time using the HACT methods of Achdou et al.
(2022). Replacing the AR(1) match quality process with an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process yields a tridiagonal generator, reducing the
computational complexity of both the value function and stationary
distribution calculations from quadratic to linear in the number of grid
points. The continuous-time model closely replicates the discrete-time
equilibrium across all key outcomes, including the share of married
households, the marriage rate, and the divorce rate, while achieving
substantial gains in computation time and memory usage.

## Replication

### Simple replication (Julia Only)

1.  Resotre the Julia environment with `julia --project=.` and
    `] instantiate`
2.  Run `julia --project=. Julia/estimation.jl` to replicate the main
    results in the paper. The output will be saved in `output/`.
3.  Run `julia --project=. Julia/benchmark.jl` to replicate the
    computational benchmarks. The output will be saved in `output/`.

### Full replication (Julia, R, and Quarto)

1.  Resotre the Julia environment with `julia --project=.` and
    `] instantiate`
2.  Set `PATH=to/julia/bin:$PATH` in `.Renviron` to make the Julia
    executable available to R
3.  Restore the R environment with `renv::restore()`
4.  Run `targets::tar_make()` to execute the full pipeline, including
    estimation, figure and table generation, and the manuscript
    rendering. The manuscript will be saved as
    `manuscript/spruce_shark_yanagimoto.pdf`.

## Why is this project named “Spruce Shark🦈”?

I like Dr. Andrew Heiss’
[idea](https://github.com/andrewheiss/testy-turtle) for a project name.
So I set the seed at `260216` (the day I opened the repository), and it
produces a codename “Spruce Shark”.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
```

    code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31).

``` r
codename(seed = 260216, type = "ubuntu")
```

    [1] "spruce shark"
