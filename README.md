# Marriage and Divorce in Continuous Time


## Replication

### Simple replication (Julia Only)

1.  Resotre the Julia environment with `julia --project=.` and
    `] instantiate`
2.  Run `julia --project=. Julia/estimation.jl` to replicate the main
    results in the paper. The output will be saved in `output/`.
3.  Run `julia --project=. Julia/benchmark.jl` to replicate the
    computational benchmarks. The output will be saved in `output/`.

### Full replication (Julia, R, and Quarto)

1.  Resotre the Julia environment with `julia --project=.` and
    `] instantiate`
2.  Set `PATH=to/julia/bin:$PATH` in `.Renviron` to make the Julia
    executable available to R
3.  Restore the R environment with `renv::restore()`
4.  Run `targets::tar_make()` to execute the full pipeline, including
    estimation, figure and table generation, and the manuscript
    rendering. The manuscript will be saved as
    `manuscript/spruce_shark_yanagimoto.pdf`.

## Why is this project named “Spruce Shark”?

I like Dr. Andrew Heiss’
[idea](https://github.com/andrewheiss/testy-turtle) for a project name.
So I set the seed at `260216` (the day I opened the repository), and it
produces a codename “Spruce Shark”.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
```

    code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31).

``` r
codename(seed = 260216, type = "ubuntu")
```

    [1] "spruce shark"
