# Spruce Shark


## Why is this project named “Spruce Shark”?

I like Dr. Andrew Heiss’
[idea](https://github.com/andrewheiss/testy-turtle) for a project name.
So I set the seed at `260216` (the day I opened the repository), and it
produces a codename “Spruce Shark”.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
```

    code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31).

``` r
codename(seed = 260216, type = "ubuntu")
```

    [1] "spruce shark"
