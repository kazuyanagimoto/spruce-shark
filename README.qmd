## Why is this project named "Spruce Shark"?

I like Dr. Andrew Heiss' [idea](https://github.com/andrewheiss/testy-turtle) for a project name.
So I set the seed at `260216` (the day I opened the repository), and it produces a codename "Spruce Shark".

```{r}
#| label: codename
library(codename)
codename_message()

codename(seed = 260216, type = "ubuntu")
```
